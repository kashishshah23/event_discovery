# Event Discovery — UI Showcase Project

## Project Overview
The **Event Discovery** app is a **UI/UX-focused showcase** built for demonstrating clean, modern, and highly interactive event browsing experiences.  
It focuses entirely on **frontend design** — using Tailwind CSS, smooth transitions, animations, and a mobile-friendly responsive layout to create an engaging user interface.

The app is designed to mimic a real-world **event finder platform** where users can explore curated, trending, and nearby events.  
Rather than connecting to a backend, this project focuses on **polished visuals**, **dynamic image rendering**, and **interactive components** such as story modals and light/dark mode.

   - Preloaded high-quality images ensure minimal load time for better UX.

3. **Responsive Hero Section**  
   - Large headline with gradient effects (`Find your next event.`).
   - Left side: Event tags (`curated`, `trending`, `nearby`) with emoji icons.  
   - Right side: Featured event image with rounded corners.

4. **Event Explore Grid**  
   - Cards for different categories (Music, Art, Conferences, etc.).
   - Category tags shown above each image.
   - Hover animations and shadows for depth.

5. **Reduced Empty Space**  
   - Layout adjusted to minimize wasted margins while keeping a breathable design.

## Purpose of This Project
This is not a full-stack application — the goal is to **demonstrate mastery of UI/UX design**.  
This includes:
- Proper use of **spacing, typography, and colors**.
- Implementation of **interactive modals and transitions**.
- **Mobile responsiveness**.
- **Dynamic image handling** for fast-loading visual content.
